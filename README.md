# Functional Programming in Idris 2

The goal of this project is quickly explained: To become a more
or less comprehensive guide to the Idris programming language,
with a lot of introductory material targeted at newcomers to
functional programming.

The content will be organized in several parts, with the part
about the core language features being the main guide to
functional programming in Idris. Every part consists of several
tutorials, each trying to cover in depth a certain aspect
of the Idris programming language and its core libraries. Most
tutorials come with (sometimes lots of) exercises, with
solutions available in directory `src/Solutions`.

Right now, even the part about core language features is not
yet finished, but is being actively developed and tried on
several of my own students, some of which are completely
new to functional programming.

## Table of Contents

1. Part 1: Core Language Features

   This part tries to give a solid introduction to the
   Idris programming language. If you are new to functional programming,
   make sure to follow these tutorials in order and *solve all the
   exercises*.

   If you already used other pure functional programming languages like
   Haskell, you might go through the introductory material (Functions Part 1,
   Algebraic Data Types, and Interfaces) pretty quickly, as most of this
   stuff will already be familiar to you.
